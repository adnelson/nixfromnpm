# nixfromnpm

![Build status](https://circleci.com/gh/adnelson/nixfromnpm/tree/master.svg?style=shield&circle-token=5449a1733b88cfef7ce7ea5f171990d6001214bb)

Translate NPM packages to Nix expressions.

### What it does

Given the name of one or more packages and an output directory,
queries NPM repositories for those packages' definitions and those of
their dependencies, and generates a set of nix expressions in the
given output directory which not only can be used to build the
requested packages, but also to build any of their dependencies as
desired.

* The packages generated are easily human readable.
* They can be modified as desired after they are built, and these
  modifications will remain in place. For example, if a package relies
  on non-NPM dependencies, or requires extra build steps such as
  patching, these changes can be added by hand and will be respected
  down the line.
* Since builds use pre-existing packages, repeated expression
  generation is fast. For example, if you generate the expression for
  one package, and then generate the expression for another package
  which shares dependencies with the first (even if the second is
  built at a later time), the shared dependencies will not be
  regenerated.

### Advantages over `npm2nix`

`npm2nix` is another tool which can generate nix expressions from an
npm package. However, it has several drawbacks. It generates the
entire dependency tree for an npm package, without availing itself of
results of previous invocations. This is inefficient, since duplicated
packages are built multiple times. The resulting expression is a
single monolithic file which is hard to grok, and hard to
modify. Furthermore, any modifications performed would have to be done
each time the package was regenerated. It also discourages committing
of the resulting package into source control, since it's large and has
to be continually regenerated whenever changes are made. This means
that packages built with it are unlikely to be cached in a nix store
or repo.

### Installation

Clone the `nixfromnpm` repo.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adnelson/nixfromnpm
$ cd nixfromnpm
```

Make sure you have nix installed, and `nixpkgs` is in your `NIX_PATH`
environment variable. Then run:

```bash
$ nix-env --install --attr nixfromnpm --file ./release.nix
```

If you'd like to try out `nixfromnpm` without installing it, or just
hack on it, you can use it in a `nix-shell`:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/nixfromnpm
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell:nixfromnpm]$ cabal run -- <arguments>
```

### Usage

#### Using the `nix-node-packages` repo

I recommend using the
[`nix-node-packages`](https://github.com/adnelson/nix-node-packages)
repo for most applications. This repo contains several thousand node
package definitions already, which means whatever you're trying to
build might already be defined. It also contains some packages which
are hand-written or hand-modified from what had been auto-generated by
`nixfromnpm` (fixing bugs or performing additional build steps). To use
the repo, clone it and then specify it as an "output" when calling
`nixfromnpm`. Of course, if the package already exists you can just build
it immediately with `nix-build`.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/adnelson/nix-node-packages
$ nixfromnpm -o nix-node-packages -p 'the-package-I-need@the-version-I-need'
$ nix-build nix-node-packages -A nodePackages.the-package-I-need_the-version-I-need
```

See that repo's `README.md` for information.

If you don't use the repo, the commands below will still work, but some of the packages which the repo provides fixes for might fail to build.

#### Generating an expression for a package

The most basic usage is providing an `-o` (`--output`) flag and one or
more `-p` flags:

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -o /some/path -p package_name -p other_package_name
```

This will build the packages called `package_name` and
`other_package_name`, and put all of the generated expressions in
`/some/path`. That path will be created if it doesn't exist. If the
output path does exist, a package will only be fetched if a nix
expression for it doesn't already exist.

You can also specify a version bound on the packages you are fetching,
using `@`:

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package_name@version_bound -o /some/path
```

Any NPM version bound is valid; so for example:

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p foo@0.8.6 -o /some/path
$ nixfromnpm -p 'foo@>=0.8 <0.9' -o /some/path
$ nixfromnpm -p 'foo@~1.0.0' -o /some/path
```

#### Generating an expression from a package.json file

You can also generate an expression for a project on the local disk by
passing in the path to a `package.json` file, or a directory
containing one. The generated expression will be placed in a file
called `project.nix` in the same directory as the `package.json` file,
and a `default.nix` will be created in the directory as well which
calls into `project.nix`. As with normal usage, the `-o` flag is used
to specify a path to where generated expressions will be placed;
however, only the *downsteam* dependencies will be put here, while the
expression itself will be in the `project.nix` file.

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -f /path/to/package.json -o /path/to/dependency/set
```

You can give multiple `-f` arguments to build multiple expressions on
disk, and it can be used alongside `-p` arguments as well.

#### Extending package libraries

If there is an existing set of packages located in `/path/to/library`,
you might want to build a new set of packages without modifying the
existing set. For example, it might be read-only, or you might want to
separate private packages from public. You can do this with
extensions:


```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package -o /some/path --extend /path/to/library
# OR
$ nixfromnpm -f /path/to/package -o /some/path --extend /path/to/library
```

This will discover all of the packages in `/path/to/library` and make
them available in the generated expressions at `/some/path`, but will
not modify the library at all. Extensions can also be specified with
`-e`

You can pass in multiple libraries with multiple invocations of
`--extend`, but the libraries must have distinct base names
(e.g. `/path/lib1`, `/path/lib2`). If two libraries share a base name,
you can rename them with a `NAME=PATH` syntax, e.g. `-E
lib1=/path1/lib -E lib2=/path2/lib`.

#### Development Dependencies

NPM packages differentiate between dependencies needed at runtime and
dependencies required only when developing on a package (e.g. packages
for testing, transpilers for compile-to-javascript languages, etc). A
package might have a great number of development dependencies, and
there might be circular dependencies with development packages because
the packages are not required at runtime. For this reason it's
generally better to avoid generating expressions for development
dependencies unless they're needed, because they add a lot of extra
work and generate a lot of files.

`nixfromnpm` lets you generate expressions for development
dependencies at a maximum depth. For example, depth `0` means don't
make any development dependency expressions; depth `1` means create
expressions for the package being built, but not any of their
development dependencies, etc.

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package_name -o /some/path --dev-depth 1
```

#### Extra registries

For a package in a private registry located at `https://my.registry:2345`:

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p private_package -o /some/path -r https://my.registry:2345
```

#### Github authorization

For npm packages which fetch from git, if an authorization token is required:

```bash
$ nixfromnpm -p package -o /some/path --github-token llnl23uinlaskjdno34nedhoaidjn5o48wugn
```

This can also be set by a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

#### Private NPM namespaces

NPM offers private packaging, where you can specify a *namespace* or
*scope* under which a package lives. For example, a package might be
designated as `@foo/bar`, where the package is called `bar` and the
namespace is called `foo`. `nixfromnpm` supports this, as long as you
have set up your NPM repo to use authorization tokens (see
documentation for details). To use this, set an environment variable
`NPM_AUTH_TOKENS`, with the following format:

```
mynamespace=mytoken:myothernamespace=myothertoken:...
```

Where tokens are keyed on namespaces. Then when building the
expression set, if a namespaced package is encountered, `nixfromnpm`
will look up the namespace in this environment variable to determine
what token to use for authentication. The same environment variable is
read when the packages are built with `nix-build`. The path to the
package in the generated expressions is slightly different:

```bash
$ export NPM_AUTH_TOKENS="foo=a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a1a"
$ nixfromnpm -o my_expressions -p '@foo/bar'
$ nix-build my_expressions -A namespaces.foo.bar
```

#### Caching of packages

By default, `nixfromnpm` will discover all existing packages in the
specified output directory (provided via tha `-o` flag). However, if
you would like to generate all of these from scratch, you can disable
caching with `--no-cache`.

#### Troubleshooting a package that doesn't build

There are any number of reasons why a package might not build. Some of
the most common ones are:

* The `nixfromnpm` tool wasn't able to generate the definition of one of the package's dependencies. It will insert in the `brokenPackage` function, which, as might be anticipated, never builds. Looking at the call to `brokenPackage` will tell you why it couldn't build it. In my experience, this is because `nixfromnpm`'s version range checker is not completely up to spec, and it's unable to find a version that satisfies the bounds given by a `package.json`. If this is the case, the easiest way to fix it is to:
  * See what version range `nixfromnpm` failed to resolve. E.g. `foo@>=1.2.3-bar <2.3.4-baz.qux`.
  * Use `npm` to manually build the package at the given version bounds. E g. `npm install foo@>=1.2.3-bar <2.3.4-baz.qux`.
  * See what version it ends up building. E.g. `foo@1.2.3-xyz`.
  * Call `nixfromnpm` on that version. E.g. `nixfromnpm -o /path/to/nix-node-packages -p 'foo@1.2.3-xyz'`.
  * Replace the call to `brokenPackage` with `foo_1-2-3-xyz`.
* The build fails with `npm` complaining about HTTP errors. This is usually caused by a dependency that wasn't satified, likely because `nixfromnpm` calculated the wrong dependency. In this case, use steps similar to the above to find out what the actual dependency should be, and modify the package definition to include the correct one.
* A package build script is attempting to do some hacky bullshit like modifying its dependencies. This, of course, is not kosher in the `nix` view of things. In this case, you'll probably want to `nix-shell` into the package and see what it's trying to do. Figure out how to stop it from doing these things, and supply `prePatch` or `postPatch` steps to apply those changes.

The good news is that if you patch or otherwise fix a broken package, it will not be overwritten by subsequent invocations of `nixfromnpm` (*although*, I highly recommend keeping your expressions in source control in case bad things happen!).

### Contributions

This project has gone from what I thought would be a weekend project
to a pretty significant undertaking. I think it has the potential to
be pretty useful to JS developers who are interested in using nix, and
it's already usable, with
[thousands of packages](https://github.com/adnelson/nix-node-packages)
defined (although there's no guarantee, of course, that these all
work). However, there are still a number of
[issues](https://github.com/adnelson/nixfromnpm/issues) which need to
be addressed. I very heartily welcome contributions, whether error
reporting or pull requests.
